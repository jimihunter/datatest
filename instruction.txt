Explanation and How to execute the code

Alternative approach I would have used would be to use an ORM so that it will be alot easier 
and less verbose in achieving this task. It will also remove the sql query part because with the ORM
approach it will be alot easier to chain actions together. However, this comes with its own complexity.

How to run the code and dependencies

In other to run this code the following steps needs to be followed

1. install the dependencies in the requirements.txt file thus:
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
2. navigate to the directory ../datatest/src
3. run the command python app.py from the terminal or cmd

for running test
